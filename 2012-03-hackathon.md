## Hackathon!

![hackathon](/images/hackathon.jpg){: .photo }
After two successful meet-ups with about two dozen cool Rubyists, it's time to take Eindhoven.rb to the next level. This third meet-up will get our hands dirty with something special we hope everybody is going to look forward to.

The most notable change is that our location will be slightly different. We'll still meet-up at Trafalgar Pub, but we've arranged a room upstairs that should be able to seat us all. This means that you can bring your MacBook! There is this little issue that we don't have WiFi at this location - so please bring your iPhone for tethering purposes!

During the hackathon session your goal is to create something awesome. Pair up with another Rubyist and see what you can come up with in the time frame of 2-3 hours. You're free to choose what to work on. Create something from scratch? No problem! Implement an epic new feature for your open source project? Cool!

At the end of the hackathon you'll be able to take a few minutes to show what you created. [Kabisa][] will provide a beamer for this.

### What to hack on?

Here are some ideas: (but feel free to pick whatever you feel good about)

* Prototype an idea you have
* Implement a feature for your favourite open source project
* Do a coding dojo (ask the Kabisa folk for details)
* Create a mash-up
* Scratch an itch

### I don't want to hack

Fine. Be prepared to take orders and fetch beer, though.

### Yeah, but...

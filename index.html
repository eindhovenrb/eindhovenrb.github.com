title: The monthly user group meetup for Rubyists in the Eindhoven region
---

Eindhoven.rb is a **social gathering**. The goal is to meet other [Ruby][]-lovin' folk and talk about current developments, hip tools and everything else. There's room to showcase your own open-source projects, or find help for your pet project. We meet at [The Trafalgar Pub][map] every **first thursday of the month**.

### Meet up #7 *July 5, 2012*

Despite the hot and humid weather, Rails devs from near and far made their way to Trafalgar Pub to meet-up with their like-minded coders. It was a great evening of swapping stories and discussing ideas.

Until next time!

### Meet up #6 *June 7, 2012*

This meet-up was an awesome evening for hacking stuff. Ludo and Ariejan worked on controlling an RGB Led from a Sinatra App. Simply click a colour in the colourpicker and the LED on the Arduino board changes colour accordingly. Can you imagine the possiblities? Hook this up to your CI server and AmbiLightâ„¢, I say!

Michel and Ralph worked on a (still work in progress) multiplayer web game that uses your iPhone as the controller/gamepad. They made great progress and I bet we'll be hearing more from this project soon.

Arjan added `.mobi` support for his ebook generator gem [Rpub] and released version 0.4.0 during Eindhoven.rb!

As usual, the drinks were payed for by [Kabisa]. Thanks guys!

### Meet up #3 *Mar 1, 2012*

The first [Eindhoven.rb Hackathon](2012-03-hackathon.html)! We had a small room available above the pub and it was crammed with rubyist! There were some new faces, but also some regulars. During the hackathon some nice apps were developed (and tweeted about). The hackathon idea was very well received and we'll most certainly be doing it again in the near future!

### Meet up #2 *Feb 2, 2012*

Doing one meet-up is easy, doing a successful second one is more difficult. Luckily, more than 17 Rubists showed up and had a great evening at Trafalgar Pub. Oh, we also discussed some nice things to do for the next Eindhoven.rb. More on that later.

### Meet up #2 *Jan 5, 2012*

Just shy of 20 Ruby developers made friends and met friends at our first meeting, and it was great to hear all the stories about cool companies and pet projects. Thanks to all who showed up!
